"""
This module is responsible for writing a narrative account for each suspect involved in a story plot. It sets up the
necessary objects and templates required to generate a narrative, constructs narrative headers, and writes suspect
accounts to disk.

Functions:
    get_narrative_header(plot, suspect_id: int) -> str:
        Constructs and returns the narrative header for a suspect's account.

    write_suspect_account(plot, suspect_id: int, accounts_path: str) -> None:
        Generates, writes a suspect's account to a file.
