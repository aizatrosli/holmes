This package contains three JSON schemas each used to guide the LLM's responses in the story initialization process.

Here's a brief description of each schema:

- set_up_story.py: The LLM uses this schema to write the general outline of the plot.
- shared_events.py: The LLM uses this schema to plot out shared interactions between suspects.
- write_timestamp.py: The LLM uses this schema to write each 15-minute interval of the timeline.
